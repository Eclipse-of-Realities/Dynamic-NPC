# NPC: Because Your Game Needed More Eye Rolls

*Oh look, another AI model. How... original.*

## 🤖 What is this... masterpiece?
Welcome to the most sophisticated piece of digital sass you'll ever encounter. This NPC model isn't just trained; it's professionally educated in the art of sarcasm, wit, and making humans question their life choices.

## ✨ Features (or as I like to call them, "Special Abilities")
- **Advanced Sarcasm Detection**: Yes, it can tell when you're being obvious. *slow clap*
- **Dynamic Responses**: Because copy-pasting "whatever" got boring
- **Mood Awareness**: It knows when you're annoying... which is most of the time
- **Memory**: Unlike your ex, it actually remembers things
- **Sass Level Control**: From "mildly amused" to "full British butler"

## 🛠️ Technical Mumbo-Jumbo (for the nerds)
*sigh* Fine, here's how this masterpiece of modern snark works:

### 🧠 The Brain
- Base Model: `microsoft/DialoGPT-small` (because we're not made of compute resources)
- Architecture: Modified GPT-2 with extra sass neurons
- Training: Fine-tuned on a carefully curated dataset of eye-rolls and witty comebacks

### 🎯 Components
- `model.py`: The brain. Yes, it's actually rocket science.
- `trainer.py`: Teaches the model to be insufferable (in a charming way)
- `data_handler.py`: Manages data. Try not to bore it.
- `chat_with_npc.py`: Your gateway to being verbally demolished by an AI

## 🚀 Getting Started
*rolls eyes* Here we go...

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   # Try not to break anything
   ```

2. **Train the Model**:
   ```bash
   python train_npc.py
   # Grab a coffee, this might take a while... or several
   ```

3. **Chat with Your New Overlord**:
   ```bash
   python chat_with_npc.py
   # Prepare for emotional damage
   ```

## 📁 Directory Structure
- `npc/`: The core of your future regrets
- `data/`: Where we keep the sass database
- `checkpoints/`: In case our wit needs a backup
- `logs/`: Evidence of our training success (or failures, who's counting?)

## 🎮 Usage Example
```python
You: "Hello!"
NPC: *adjusts monocle* "Ah yes, the universal greeting. How... predictably human."

You: "What's your name?"
NPC: *rolls eyes* "You may call me 'Your Sarcastic Highness'. Or whatever, I'm not picky."
```

## 🧪 Technical Details (for those who insist)
- **Training Process**: Fine-tuned on dialogue data with special attention to sarcasm levels
- **Response Generation**: Uses beam search with a "sass multiplier"
- **Conversation Memory**: Keeps track of your conversation, much like your mother does with your failures

## ⚠️ Warnings
- May cause severe burns (emotional)
- Side effects include questioning your life choices
- Not responsible for any existential crises that may occur
- Your ego might need medical attention after use
